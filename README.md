Simple Spigot server for Minecraft

Use `build.sh` for building the image (or pull the latest from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lyspoul/minecraft-spigot-server/general)

Use `run.sh --world [WORLD_NAME]` to run the server. This will create a `worlds/[WORLD_NAME]` subdirectory in the current directory. Use the --mode [creative|survival]
to set the gamemode
